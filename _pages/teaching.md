      Soils are loose and porous, allowing roots to penetrate deeply, and providing essential support and access to water, nutrients, and air. Did you know soil also acts as a leaky reservoir, regulating water movement both downward and upward? How do different soils retain water, and how do plants extract the nutrients they need? If these questions intrigue you, this is the class you wonâ€™t want to miss! Explore the fascinating world of soil-plant-water interactions and uncover the processes that sustain life. (FIGURE on the left came from the ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL PHYSICS by DR. Daniel Hillel)<br>

      Syllabus will be provided soon!
